# 16.1 THE TOWERS OF HANOI PROBLEM A peg contains rings in sorted order, with
# the largest ring being the lowest. You are to transfer these rings to another
# peg, which is initially empty. This is illustrated in Figure 16.1. PI P2 P3
# PI P2 P3 (a) Initial configuration. (b) Desired configuration. Figure 16.1:
# Tower of Hanoi with 6 pegs. Write a program which prints a sequence of
# operations that transfers n rings from one peg to another. You have a third
# peg, which is initially empty. The only operation you can perform is taking a
# single ring from the top of one peg and placing it on the top of another peg.
# You must never place a larger ring above a smaller ring. Hint: If you know
# how to transfer the top n â€”1 rings, how does that help move the nth ring?
